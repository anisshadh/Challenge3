# Password Generator
## Description
This website consists of a random password generator that generates password based on user criterion. A prompt box is used for user input which is then sorted out to produce the random password through JavaScript. The user can choose whether or not they want uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or symbols. Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, the password is generated dynamically. People often choose weak passwords and reuse them across websites. This leads to loss of security. By using this password generator, a strong password can be chosen that is less prone to compromises. 

## Usage
All that is needed to be done is load the site, click "generate password", and then answer the prompts based on password desire. The password will then be displayed and is ready to be copied and used. 


Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
